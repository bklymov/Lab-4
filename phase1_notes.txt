Step 1

1. What status line did you get and what does it mean?
HTTP/1.1 200 OK. 
It means: Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
2. What is the Server header value? Is it specific (nginx/1.22) or generic?
Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)

Step 2

1. What is the <title> of the page (if present)?
<title>Go ahead and ScanMe!</title>
2. Do you see any <form> elements? What are their action attributes (copy them)?
<form class="nst-search" id="nst-head-search" action="/search/">

Step 3

1. Did requests and curl report the same status and server header?
Yes, they did.
2. If different, what header or other factor might explain it (redirects, default headers, user agent)?

Step 4

1. Did the response change (status, server header, content-length) when the User-Agent was MyTestAgent/1.0?
No
2. If it had changed, what could that mean about the server’s defenses?
