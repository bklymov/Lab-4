Step 1

1. What status line did you get and what does it mean?
HTTP/1.1 200 OK. 
It means: Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
2. What is the Server header value? Is it specific (nginx/1.22) or generic?
Server: Apache/2.4.7 (Ubuntu)

Step 2

1. What is the <title> of the page (if present)?
<title>Go ahead and ScanMe!</title>
2. Do you see any <form> elements? What are their action attributes (copy them)?
<form class="nst-search" id="nst-head-search" action="/search/">

Step 3

1. Did requests and curl report the same status and server header?
Yes, they did.
2. If different, what header or other factor might explain it (redirects, default headers, user agent)?

Step 4

1. Did the response change (status, server header, content-length) when the User-Agent was MyTestAgent/1.0?
No
2. If it had changed, what could that mean about the server’s defenses?
Some server's may block, redirect, or return different content depending on their 
firewalls or server rules

Step 5

1. What three pieces of information from the steps above would be most useful in a reconnaissance report, and why?
HTTP Status code, Server header, Forms and input fields
2. One quick defensive suggestion an admin could use to reduce information leakage from headers.
Do not include the version of a server.
